# Java Spring CRUD app

* Using only Java and Bootstrap
* I have created a simple crud application with Java Spring. The theme of this app is a bookstore where I can add a new book (stored in local memory), show it on the screen and there are buttons that lead to editing or deleting the book.
* This project was created for a school assignment.
